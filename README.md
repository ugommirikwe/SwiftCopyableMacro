# Overview

`SwiftCopyableMacro` is a very simple Swift macro library that auto-generates a `copy()` function for structs at compile time, which takes all the public properties of the struct as arguments in the function, enabling a runtime ability to elegantly duplicate an instance of the struct and setting new values for any or all these (even immutable) properties at the same time, similar to what [Kotlin's `data class`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html#copying) offers.

The only effort required is to mark the structs with a custom `@Copyable` annotation and the structs are automatically injected with a `copy()` method inside. For example:

```swift
@Copyable // <= annotation is used here
struct User {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}
```

automatically updates the struct at compile time (which happens instantly if editing the file inside of Xcode) as follows:

```swift
struct User {
    let name: String
    let age: Int

    // Notice the arguments for the function ðŸ‘‡
    func copy(name: String? = nil, age: Int? = nil) -> Self {
        .init(
            name: name ?? self.name
            age: age ?? self.age
        )
    }
}
```

This struct can now be used at a call site like so:

```swift
let ugo = User(name: "Ugo", age: 30)
print(ugo) // Ugo(name: "Ugo", age: 30)

let ugoAsJack = ugo.copy(name: "Jack") // <= .copy() is used here
print(ugoAsJack) // Ugo(name: "Jack", age: 30)

let ugoIsOlder = ugo.copy(age: 34) // <= .copy() is used here
print(ugoIsOlder) // Ugo(name: "Ugo", age: 34)
print(ugoAsJack) // Ugo(name: "Jack", age: 30)

let jackIsYounger = ugoAsJack.copy(age: 25) // <= .copy() is used here
print(jackIsYounger) // Ugo(name: "Jack", age: 25)
```

Xcode will even offer autocomplete listing all the properties declared in the struct as parameters in this `.copy(...)` function.

# Installation
This macro is available for installation via the Swift Package Manager (SPM) as follows:

## Xcode
1. In Xcode, select the menu: `File` â†’ `Add Package Dependenciesâ€¦` to launch the SPM dialog;
2. in the "Search or Enter Package URL" text field, enter the package URL: https://github.com/ugommirikwe/SwiftCopyableMacro;
3. in "Dependency Rule" select "Branch";
4. in the "Branch" text field enter the value "main"
5. select the project to add the 

## package.swift
For projects that use a `package.swift` file to manage their SPM dependencies, you can add it to your `package.swift` file like so:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ugommirikwe/SwiftCopyableMacro", .branch("main"))
]
```

And then add the product to all targets that use CopyableMacro:

```swift
...
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "<NameOfYourTarget>", 
        dependencies: ["CopyableMacro"],
    )
]
```

# Import & Usage
The [overview](#overview) section above already describes how to use the macro: prepend your struct name with the annotation `@Copyable` and that's all. Xcode 15+ should automatically add the import at the top of the file for you. Otherwise, go ahead and add it as follows to clear any errors in your file:

```swift
import CopyableMacro
```

# Pre-Release
Please note that this code is still in pre-release stage and should be carefully evaluated before using in your production code.
